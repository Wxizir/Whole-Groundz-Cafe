          Whole Groundz Cafe is a dream come true I love to drink coffee and every time I
          drink of coffee at Starbucks or in any coffee house I visualize about having my own
          coffee shop. Though,it could have remained as a dream till I found the Coffee company
          Organo Gold (OG) who is offering a coffee shop business for a very affordable price.
          I availed the package after a year it was introduced to me.I got excited to avail
          without even having any place yet to start my coffee shop,but with that attractive
          investment package, I just grabbed the offer right away and said “bahala na” but then 
          I realized it’s not that easy. I have to do something about the products I have on hand
          or else it'll be all expired and will be gone to waste.
          After that excitement and realization, I started joining events. I joined the New
          City Charity Fun Run which is a run for a cause event which of course didn’t really help
          me gain anything other than getting promoted and the experience I felt when helping
          people through my business,then joined events like car shows and charity bazaars.
          After that,I found a small place to rent, small space in a salon. Then 6 months later 
          I found a much bigger place but it’s still a shared place in a salon & spa center. After
          all those happenings, I finally registered my business name in March 2017 which was
          Whole Groundz Coffee Hub, which serves as a cafe and of course at the same time I
          also include coffee distribution of Organo Gold in my business.
          After a year, of jumping in to this biggest leap of my life, and grab this place while 
          only having only faith & trust in my heart.I changed the hub into cafe, all the
          hardship plus prayers, trust and big big faith finally paid off, I finally have a Coffee
          shop that I can call my own and really seeing it under my name. 
          “Whole Groundz Cafe” 
          Whole Groundz Cafe’s Grand Opening was on July 28, 2018. It was one of the most 
          achieving moments of my life.Whole for it's completeness of the business 
          that I am dreaming of. Groundzfor God provided it to be cultivated and be used to sow goodness & reap according to His plans. 
          Whole Groundz Cafe is a coffee shop that serves Gourmet 
          Coffee that provides health benefits in every cup.
